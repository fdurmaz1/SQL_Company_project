# Company Database Project
This project focuses on the development and management of a Company database, encompassing the creation of the database structure with tables for stores and employees, the insertion of relevant data, and the execution of SQL queries for data retrieval. Aimed at demonstrating fundamental database operations, it serves as a practical example of SQL usage in setting up, populating, and querying a relational database.
